Alphabet Soup Charity Prediction - Deep Learning Model Report

Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier deep learning model to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup Charity. The model was trained on a dataset containing various information about the applicants, including the type of application, the use of the requested funds, and the nature of the organization, among others.

Results:

Data Preprocessing

    Target Variable: The target for the model is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column. This binary variable indicates whether the money was used effectively by the funded project.

    Feature Variables: The features for the model include variables such as 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', 'ASK_AMT'. These variables provide various details about the application.

    Excluded Variables: Variables like 'EIN' and 'NAME' were removed from the input data because they are identification information, not useful for the modeling process.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

    Model Architecture: The deep learning model was designed with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The first hidden layer contains 80 neurons and the second one contains 30 neurons. All layers used the ReLU activation function, except the output layer which used the sigmoid function due to our binary classification task.

    Performance: Unfortunately, the model did not initially reach the target accuracy of 75%. It achieved an accuracy of about 73% on the training data and 72% on the testing data.

    Steps to Improve Performance: To try to increase model performance, we implemented early stopping, and experimented with adding additional neurons, adding more hidden layers, and using different activation functions. We also implemented a hyperparameter tuning process using Keras Tuner to find an optimal set of hyperparameters.

Summary:

In summary, the deep learning model shows a promising ability to predict the success of charity-funded projects, with an accuracy of over 70%. However, the model fell slightly short of the target 75% accuracy. The process of tuning and training the model highlighted the importance of selecting the correct architecture, choosing an appropriate number of neurons, and preprocessing the data effectively.

In terms of recommendations for further analysis, we could explore other machine learning models, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which might perform well on this dataset. Alternatively, we could investigate more sophisticated neural network architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have been successful in more complex prediction tasks. We could also look into using different feature selection techniques to reduce the dimensionality of our input data and potentially improve our model's performance.
